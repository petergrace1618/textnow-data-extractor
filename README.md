# tde -- Textnow Data Extractor
## The Problem
I requested my call and text message history from my cell phone provider at the time, Textnow, in preparation for a potential court case, because the defendant admitted her wrongdoing in several text messages and a voicemail. 

I could have taken screenshots of the text messages, but photos can be altered, and a lawyer instructed me that I want to avoid a situation where it was my word against hers; so to preclude this I used the same method that a law enforcement agency or an attorney would use to subpoena the information.

As [this email](textnow-data-disclosure-email/index.html) shows, the data download is separated into multiple files and folders. The pertinent files are calls.json, messages.json, and user_shard.json which contains my contact list.

## The Solution
